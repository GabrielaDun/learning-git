		<h1 class ="title">IF BY RUDYARD KIPLING</h1>
		<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>   
   		Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br>
		If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
   		But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>   
		If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br> 
		Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
		Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
   		 And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br></p>

		<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
   		 If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
		If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
   		 And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>   
		If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
		Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
		Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
		 And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br>
</p>
