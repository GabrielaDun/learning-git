        <p>If you can keep your head when all about you <br>  
            Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>    
            If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br> 
            But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>    
            If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br> 
            Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br> 
            Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br> 
            And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br> 
        </p>

        <p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>    
            If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>    
            If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br> 
            And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>    
            If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br> 
            Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br> 
            Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br> 
            And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>

        <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br> 
            And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br> 
            And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br> 
            And never breathe a word about your loss;<br> 
            If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br> 
            To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>    
            And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br> 
            Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>

        <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>    
            Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br> 
            If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br> 
            If all men count with you, but none too much;<br> 
            If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br> 
            With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>    
            Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>    
            And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
